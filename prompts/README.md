# AI-Assisted Curriculum Generation Strategy

This document outlines a recommended hierarchical, top-down approach for generating educational course content, specifically focusing on creating assignments with aligned tests using AI. This multi-step process is effective for ensuring coherence and relevance.

Here's why this approach is recommended:

1.  **Context is King:** Generating assignments in isolation often leads to them feeling disconnected or not quite fitting the learner's progression. By starting with the overall course plan, you establish the context: What should the learner know _before_ this week? What is the _goal_ of this week? What comes _next_? This context is crucial for designing relevant assignments and appropriate tests.
2.  **Logical Progression:** A course needs a narrative flow. Defining the weekly themes/topics first ensures that concepts build upon each other logically. This structure prevents overwhelming beginners or introducing advanced topics prematurely.
3.  **Manageable Complexity:** Generating a full 12-week course with detailed lessons, multiple assignments per week, _and_ well-balanced tests all in one go is extremely complex, even for an advanced AI. Breaking it down into:
    - **Step 1: High-Level Structure (Course Plan):** Focuses on the big picture, sequence, and major topics.
    - **Step 2: Mid-Level Detail (Unit/Weekly Plan):** Focuses on specific learning objectives, key concepts for that unit, and potentially types of activities.
    - **Step 3: Granular Content (Assignments & Tests):** Focuses on creating specific tasks and robust validation, directly informed by the objectives defined in Step 2.
      ...makes each step more focused and achievable, leading to higher quality output.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** This approach allows for review and adjustment at each stage. You can tweak the overall flow (Step 1) before investing time in detailed weekly plans (Step 2), and refine weekly objectives (Step 2) before generating the specific assignments and tests (Step 3).
5.  **Alignment:** It ensures that the assignments and their tests (Step 3) are directly aligned with the learning objectives of the unit (Step 2), which in turn fit into the overall course structure (Step 1). This is key to solving the original problem of tests accurately validating the _intended_ learning.

**Therefore, the sequence:**

1.  **Prompt for High-Level Course Outline:** (Like the prompt we just created - defining weekly themes/topics for the 12 weeks).
2.  **Prompt for Detailed Unit/Weekly Plan:** Take the output from Step 1 for a _specific week_ (e.g., Week 3: Control Flow) and ask for more detail: specific learning objectives, maybe suggested explanations or activity types.
3.  **Prompt for Assignment(s) with Tests:** Take the output from Step 2 for that _same week_ and use it as input to generate one or more assignments, complete with balanced unit tests, targeting those specific objectives and concepts. (Using a prompt similar to the _first_ one we refined).

Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each week defined in Step 1.

This methodical approach is the standard practice in curriculum design and is the best way to ensure a coherent, effective learning experience where assessments genuinely measure the intended skills.
